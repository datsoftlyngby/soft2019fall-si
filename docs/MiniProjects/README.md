During the semester you will be working in groups on three mini projects, shortly described as 
- Web Services, 
- Enterprise Integration Patterns, and 
- Microservices Architecture.

All projects consist of design and development of a small software application, which illustrates a practical implementation of the system integration concepts, discussed in class.<br><br>
There is no expectation for submition of a written report, related to the project. Instead, a _public presentation_ of the solutions to the class, where _each team member_ participates, is required.

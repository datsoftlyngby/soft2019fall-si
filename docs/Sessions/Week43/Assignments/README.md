# Reading Assignment
In the coming week we go deeper into the messaging systems in enterprise integration and learn the best practices of using them.
One of the signature readings in this area is the book of Gregor Hohpe and Bobby Woolf _"Enterprise Integration Patterns
Designing, Building, and Deploying Messaging Solutions"_.<br>

Your task is to read [Chapter 3: Messaging Systems](https://www.enterpriseintegrationpatterns.com/docs/EnterpriseIntegrationPatterns_HohpeWoolf_ch03.pdf) and to create a glossary of __at least ten terms__, related to System Integration, which you find essential.

### Class Assignments on Web Services

1. Browse Internet for a public SOAP web service, which provides information about countries in the world.
Create a web service client application, which uses the service to find out and count the countries using EUR as their national      currency.

2. Create a SOAP web service, which can read a text file and find out whether the text in it contains any profanity words, and then return a boolean response.

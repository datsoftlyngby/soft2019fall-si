# Week 35: P2P Communication
This folder contains resources related to the System Integration topics, discussed during the first semester week.	
<h2>Overview</h2>
<h3>Agenda</h3>
<ul>
	<li>System Integration as a course at PBA
	<li>System Integration challenges
	<li>System Integration as a subject of system development
	<li>Integration technologies time-line
	<li>Experience with Point-to-Point integration
	<li>Coming next
</ul>	

<h3>Learning Objectives</h3>
<ul>
	<li>To get acquainted with the challenges of developing business applications
	<li>To get an overview of existing technologies and programming solutions in system integration and adopt criteria for comparing them
	<li>To be able to explain the difference between
	<ul>
		<li>tightly coupled and loosely coupled systems
		<li>synchronous and asynchronous integration
	</ul>
	<li>To get familiar with standardisation in system integration
	<li>To get programming practice in developing P2P integration using networking protocols
 </ul>
  
<h3>Teaching and Learning Activities</h3>
<ul>
	<li>Interactive presentation
	<li>Programming Exercises - applications, running on two computer
	<li>P2P projects - code sharing
	<li>Coding remote communication between two applications
	<li>Out-of-class work - reading and programming task 
 </ul>

<h3>Homework Assignments <a href="https://app.peergrade.io/teacher/courses/cad8c537-e32d-4552-b083-27aa02dfe9e6/assignments"> (Peergrade) </a> </h3>
<ul>
	<li>Reading Task<p>
		Read The Open Group Service Integration Maturity Model (OSIMM) Version 2 (http://www.opengroup.org/soa/source-book/osimmv2/) and answer the following questions:
		<ol>
			<li>How many maturity levels are defined by the standard?
			<li>Which are the maturity dimensions, used as indicators for assessment of the maturity levels?
		</ol>
	</li>
	<li>Programming Tasks
<ol>
<li>Task1 <p>
Mission: Create an application to help a user to make money transactions between her computer and the server of the bank<p>
1.Create a Client application, which <p>
- opens connection to a server with a specific IP address and port<p>
- reads data from the user: account number and (+ or -) amount of money<p>
- sends the data to the Server<p>
2.Create Server application that<p>
- defines initial amount of money in the userâ€™s account<p>
- opens connection at the specific port and accepts to listen to the client<p>
- reads the request of the client and processes it:<p>
= if the user wants to make savings (+), add the input amount to the current amount<p>
= if the user wants to withdraw money (-), checks the availability, and then either subtracts the input amount from the current amount or prints a warning message<p>
- returns a response<p>
3.Run and test both applications on the same and on two different computers<p>
			
<li>Task2 <p>
This assignment extends the Session 1 Project 2: Message Encoder.<p>
You can choose to solve it and upload the solution in addition to or instead of the Bank Service assignment.<p>
Here is the task:<p>
In reality, servers often have to serve multiple clients at the same time.<p>
Modify the demo program, provided by the instructor, in such a way so then the server would be able to listen to more than one clients at the same time.<p>
Hint: Program running multiple threads.<p>			
	
<li>Task3 <p>
This assignment extends the Session 1 Project 3: Capital Echo<p>
You can choose to solve it and upload the solution in addition to or instead of the Bank Service assignment.<p>
Here is the task:<p>
UDP protocol provides faster transmission of messages, and therefore is a preferable for transmitting large, binary and video-streaming data.<p>
Modify the demo program, provided by the instructor in such a way,, so it can be applied for sending and receiving image data from a binary file.<p>
Hint: Replace the input stream with a more appropriate one.<p>
